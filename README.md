## Tech Stack 🛠️

### Frontend 🎨

- **React** ⚛️: For dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **JavaScript** 🌐: For client-side interactivity.

### Backend ⚙️

- **Python** 🐍: Core language for backend logic, enabling robust API development and integration with AI-driven features.
- **Node.js** 🚀: For handling real-time notification APIs.

### Database 💾

- **MongoDB** 🍃: For scalable, non-relational data storage, ideal for managing user data, project logs, and task records.

### CI/CD 🌟

- **Jenkins** 🛠️: Powers a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment. The pipeline includes:
  - **Code Checkout**: Clones backend and frontend repositories from GitHub.
  - **Dependency Installation**: Installs dependencies for both backend and frontend in parallel.
  - **SonarQube Analysis**: Runs code quality checks with SonarQube to ensure maintainability and security.
  - **Unit Testing**: Executes backend unit tests with Jest, generating reports for validation.
  - **Frontend Build**: Builds the React frontend for production.
  - **Docker Deployment**: Builds and pushes Docker images to a Nexus repository for scalable deployment.
  - **Application Run**: Deploys the application using Docker Compose for seamless integration.
- **GitHub Actions** 🤖: Complements Jenkins for additional CI/CD automation, ensuring continuous integration.
